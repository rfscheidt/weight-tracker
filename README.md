# My first project in Golang

## Crud example

This is a Golang project for a getting started with some boilerplate code a bit beyond the usual 
"CRUD" examples. Some recurrent and common requirements are:

 - CRUD user;
 - CRUD weight;
 - Infra in clean architecture;

## Next step

dockerize the project

## Executable project

go run .\cmd\server\main.go
